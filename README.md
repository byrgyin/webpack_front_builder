# Webpack Builder

## Hi! This is my build for the webpack.

### This build uses the following frontend technologies:
1. #### JS
2. #### Pug
3. #### Scss

You can run two projects with the command: `npm run dev`

Build a project with the: `npm run prod`

To create a component, use the command: `create components {name}`

To create a page, use the command: `create page {name}`

`name` is the name of your page or component.
